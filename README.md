## Motivation
We wanted to design a free resource where other individuals learning how to code can practice their coding terminology. Our website uses study materials such as flashcards and quizzes in order for users to hone their skills.

## Technologies used and why

**Built with:**
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/start)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [MySQL2](https://www.mysql.com/) 
* [DotEnv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) 
* [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) 
* [Sequelize-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize-cli)

## Features
Our website features different levels of difficulties for two functionalities which the user can choose from: _(Note: more functionalities will be added later)_

1. Flashcards
2. Drag & Drop Quiz

#### Flashcards
* The user is routed to a page to select the different topics they want to review.
* After the user's selection, the user has 10 minutes to study through pre-made questions.
* When the user is ready to study, they can hit the start button and will have 10 minutes to loop through the set of flashcards or shuffle through all the cards
* When the 10 minutes are up, the user will be routed to the quiz page in order to test their knowledge in the topics of their choosing.

#### Drag & Drop Quiz
* If the user chooses the quiz from the front page, the user will be routed to the quiz page with 10 questions of different topics pretaining to the skill level of their choice.
* The user will be able to drag and drop the question to the answer area to determine if their choice was correct.
* At the end of the quiz, the user will be prompted their results.
